# Tools and Extensibility Comparison

## Codex

- Tool handling includes built-ins, dynamic tools, and MCP routing.
- MCP connection manager advertises capabilities and aggregates tools across configured servers.
- Skills are modeled and can carry env-var dependencies resolved in-session.

Design pattern: typed tool protocol + centralized orchestration.

## Gemini CLI

- Tool registry merges built-ins, discovered tools, and MCP-backed tools.
- Extension manager lifecycle includes refresh of hooks/agents/skills/memory surfaces.
- Subagent and A2A-related components are explicit in core modules.

Design pattern: extension-first modular services with scheduler-mediated tool execution.

## OpenCode

- Registry merges built-ins, experimental tools, and plugin-provided tools.
- MCP supports local stdio and remote streamable HTTP/SSE servers.
- Skills are mapped into commands/tooling and agent configuration is merged from defaults + user config.

Design pattern: provider-agnostic coding agent with integrated server and extensibility primitives.

## Claude Code repo

- Very strong extension content surface: commands, agents, skills, and hook scripts.
- Hookify demonstrates policy-like pre/post tool interception behavior in plugin code.
- Core extension loading/runtime semantics are not present in repository implementation code.

Design pattern: extension assets are visible, core engine is not.

## Copilot CLI repo

- Docs indicate MCP and plugin capabilities.
- Runtime plugin/MCP loader internals are not present in this repository snapshot.

Design pattern: distribution/documentation surface only in analyzed repo.
