# Safety, Permissions, and Sandbox Comparison

## Codex

- Central tool orchestrator mediates approvals and sandbox selection before execution.
- Explicit exec policy supports allow/prompt/forbid and prefix-rule proposal behavior.
- Platform-aware sandbox handling (macOS/Linux/Windows pathways) and retry behavior on sandbox denial.

Interpretation: highly formalized safety pipeline with runtime-level enforcement hooks.

## Gemini CLI

- Policy engine supports approval modes, wildcard matching, and rule precedence.
- Scheduler integrates policy and confirmation flow for tool execution.
- Sandbox configuration supports macOS restrictions and container-based options.

Interpretation: policy is a first-class service integrated with tool scheduling and user confirmations.

## OpenCode

- Permission system supports `allow/ask/deny` semantics at runtime.
- Tools request permissions directly (for example: edit/write/bash/external directory access).
- Non-interactive `run` flow explicitly denies interactive question/plan transitions and auto-rejects prompted permissions.

Interpretation: permission model is tightly coupled to tool actions and session flow control.

## Claude Code repo / Copilot CLI repo

- Claude repo exposes hook-level guardrail examples and script-based checks.
- Copilot repo exposes installer checks and docs claims, but not runtime safety engine internals.

Interpretation: safety internals are not fully auditable from these two repos alone.
